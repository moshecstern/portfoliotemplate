Certainly, at present, in 2020, the world is faced with the Coronavirus pandemic, requiring that we stay at home is much as possible, and therefore offering this service allows each patient to continue their therapy without leaving their home. Each therapist in the practice uses the medium that they are most comfortable with and which best suits the patient’s preferences. We can conduct sessions over the Internet where the patient and therapist can see each other and communicate much as they would in the office, allowing the patient to either use their computer, tablet, or smart phone to connect with the therapist. Other options include Facetime, Skype, Zoom, Doxy, and others. Some methods of connecting are more secure than others. For example, both Zoom and Doxy are fully HIPAA compliant, meaning the highest level of security is offered to prevent any possible access by anybody other than the patient and therapist talking with each other. Skype and FaceTime offer less security, but are still acceptable. In some cases, for example, if a patient does not have a computer or smart phone, we can simply have the session conducted by telephone, as this is now permitted under the current health crisis, when normally it is not a covered service. Thus, there are many options available for the therapist to connect with his or her patient. Government regulations have been eased to allow for as much remote therapy as possible",
